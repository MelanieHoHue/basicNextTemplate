We’ve just gone through the workflow we call DPS: Develop, Preview, and Ship.

Develop: We’ve written code in Next.js and used the Next.js development server running to take advantage of its hot reloading feature.
Preview: We’ve pushed changes to a branch on GitHub, and Vercel created a preview deployment that’s available via a URL. We can share this preview URL with others for feedback. In addition to doing code reviews, you can do deployment previews.
Ship: We’ve merged the pull request to main to ship to production.
We strongly recommend using this workflow when developing Next.js apps — it will help you iterate on your app faster.
